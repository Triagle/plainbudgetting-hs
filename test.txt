Basic Accounting with Plain Text
--------------------------------

This accounting system is pretty much as lax as it gets. It's little 
more than a glorified text calculator with CSV export. 

You declare cash flows like this
+/- <amount> <name> <x modifier>
e.g
+ 100 Salary
You can see the intermediary values with sums
- 50 Some show
This should read as 50 after passing it to the program.

All other lines are considered plain text and are not parsed, even logically tricky paragraphs.
Here is some easy-graph output, not affected:

+---+     +---+     +---+
| a | --> | b | --> | c |
+---+     +---+     +---+

The only bit of semantic meaning in the document is the paragraph. Parargraphs scope sums, and sums
within a paragraph "remember" the results of previous sums.

So in the following example the income is summed and then the expenses are are subtracted
with a final sum at the end of the paragraph that takes all income and expenses into account.

Income
------
+ 1000 Salary
=
Expenses
--------
- 300 Food
- 100 Water
---
We're going to save the total in a variable ">> varName" to do that
>> Total
=


After a paragraph however all that scope is lost and so the following sum just returns 100 rather than 700.
+ 100 test scope
=
We're going to bring back Total from the previous scope now:
<< Total
=
